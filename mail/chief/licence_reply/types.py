Generic Record Structure
---------------------
Attribute       Format      Presence    Comments
recordSeqNum    9(7)        M           Records are numbered sequentially from 1 for the file header through to the file trailer.
recordType      a(..35)     M


The definition does not include recordSeqNum that is transferred as the first field of the record.
The recordType is transferred as the second field (see Section 3.3.1).
The recordType and Attributes are identified by potential XML tag names (lower Camel case, e.g. startDate).

Character attribute formats are defined as: <type><length>
where <type> is:
        a    alphabetic characters
        A    upper case alphabetic characters
        N    numeric characters
        aN    alphanumeric characters
        AN    upper case alphabetic and numeric characters
        X    text (any permitted character, see Section 3.2)
        T    formatted text (includes ‘|’)
and <length> is:
        (n)    fixed length of n characters
        (..n)    variable length of up to n characters

Numeric attribute formats are defined as:
        9(n)    integer field of length up to n digits
        9(n).9(m)    decimal field with up to n digits before the decimal point and up to m digits after.

The presence of an attribute is defined by the following values:
        A    Absent for this transaction type/action.
        C    Conditional on the presence or absence or value of other data sent for the transaction
        M    Mandatory.
        O    Optional.
The optional attributes may not be relevant to some systems.
The use of attributes can be clarified in the Interchange Agreement.
For some attributes CHIEF can be configured on a per-system basis to check that they are not used or that their use is
restricted to particular values.
All literal values in the record specifications are enclosed in double quotes and are case sensitive (e.g. “insert”).

---------------------
Reply file definition
---------------------
The reply file has a common definition for all interfaces.
A reply file consists of a file header and a file trailer record encapsulating transaction responses and/or file errors.
The reply file structure is:

Level       Record                          Presence        Notes
1           File Header                     M               same run number as the related input file.
    2       Accepted Transaction            C               for each accepted transaction
    2       Rejected Transaction Header     C               for each rejected transaction
        3   Error                           C               at least one error
    2       Rejected Transaction Trailer    C               for each rejected transaction
    2       File Error                      C               for each error detected
1           File Trailer                    M               completion check

    Command to resend an email corresponding to the given hmrc run number

    Arguments:
    hmrc_run_number: The input run number *must* be the run number used by HMRC to identify this mail.
    If the mail has come from SPIRE then their current run number is different from the hmrc run number
    because lite-hmrc translates it when sending it to HMRC. For this reason it is important to use
    HMRC run number as the starting point when resending it.

    Based on hmrc run number the command identifies the relevant LicenceData, Mail instances and
    prepares the mail to be resent. Some assertions are included to ensure the filenames match the
    one that is being resent.

    -------------------------
    When to use this command
    -------------------------
    Below are the only cases where this command should be used,

    Case1: When a licence_data mail is sent to HMRC successfully from our system but it hasn't reached HMRC
    In this case we expect status of the mail to be 'reply_pending' and extract_type as 'licence_data'
    Besides there should be only one instance with this status.
    If the mail sent to HMRC is actually received and accepted by them and if for some reason we need to
    resend again then this command should not be used. That is because once it is accepted by their systems
    sending again with same run number is an error and will be rejected by their systems.

    Case2: When a licence_reply mail is sent to SPIRE successfully from our system but it hasn't reached SPIRE
    In this case we expect status of the mail to be 'reply_sent' and extract_type as 'licence_reply'

    Case3: When a usage_data mail is sent to SPIRE successfully from our system but it hasn't reached SPIRE
    In this case we expect status of the mail to be 'reply_sent' and extract_type as 'usage_data'
